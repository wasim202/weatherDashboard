# weatherDashboard

This weather dashboard system is built using the html, css, javascript and api tecnologies. In the seatch bar located in the left top corner of the page, the user will be able to type city name the api will come up with the weather forcast according to city name in the search bar from weatherbit.io for that specific city for that day and the next 5 days. I used bootstrap 5.2.0 to build the cards in the main page.
